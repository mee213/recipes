ingredients

Meat loaf
1 pound ground turkey
3/4 cup fresh bread crumbs (from 2 slices light whole-wheat bread)
1/2 cup finely chopped Vidalia or other sweet onions
1/3 cup grated carrot
1/4 cup 1% milk
1/4 cup tomato sauce
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Topping
2 tablespoons ketchup
2 teaspoons light brown sugar
1 teaspoon yellow mustard
preparation

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.

2. To make the meat loaf: In a large bowl, combine the turkey, bread crumbs, onions, carrot, milk, tomato sauce, egg, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Mix gently but thoroughly. Mound the meat loaf mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, patting it into a loaf shape with your hands.

3. To make the topping: In a small bowl, combine the ketchup, brown sugar, and mustard. Spoon the topping over the meat loaf, using the back of the spoon to spread it evenly.

4. Bake the meat loaf for about 45 minutes, or until the meat is no longer pink on the inside and is cooked through (165°F on an instant-read thermometer). Let it sit for 5 minutes, then slice and serve.
